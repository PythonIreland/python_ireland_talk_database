We will be having our August meetup on the 14th this month in the Science Gallery at 6:30pm sharp.

Speaker: Reetta Suonper√§

Title: Replicating a consumer sentiment index with Twitter

Description: Traditionally,a consumer sentiment index is constructed using a telephone survey of a few thousand individuals. This means that they are relatively costly, the results are reported with a lag and the monthly reporting frequency is relatively low. The way the questions are structured also limits the extent to which we can identify the drivers of sentiment. Twitter offers a possibility for faster, cheaper and more information-rich way of measuring consumer sentiment. This talk will explore an initial approach for using Twitter data to construct a consumer sentiment index and highlight some of the challenges and pitfalls.

Title: Introduction to basic bayesian methods, from first principles, using Python.

Description: This talk will introduce the basic principles of bayesian statistics, starting off from scratch. We'll start by introducing the simple ideas behind the bayesian approach, and quickly develop these ideas to the point where they can be used to do simple AB-testing. Full Python code will be provided at every step, so that its easy for programmers to understand.

If the talk goes well, you'll come out with a good overview of the basic ideas of bayesian statistics. Depending on time and interest we might even see some code for more advanced ideas like MCMC methods.

Before Ingo, Deirdre will be giving a short 10 minute talk about ""Open Data Ireland ‚Äì Challenges and Potential for Developers""

Description:

The Insight Centre for Data Analytics, NUI Galway is currently collaborating with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on advancing Open Data initiatives in Ireland. As part of this process we are tasked with, among other things, drawing together best practice standards for the publication and re-use of Open Data, providing an assessment of sectors where the publication of Open Data has the potential for creating a significant economic and/or societal impact, and defining a road-map on how to progress the project following the initial period of work.

In order to build a sustainable Open Data initiative, it is important to acknowledge the objectives, challenges and needs of all stakeholders, from data publishers and intermediaries, to data-users. Developers are often held up as key data-users in the Open Data value chain.

I would like to attend this week's Python Ireland to discuss Open Data challenges, datasets and objectives that are particularly pertinent for developers, with the goal of including the feedback in our report. As the project we are working on with the government is limited to six weeks and the tasks are quite wide, it is not included in our remit to hold full consultations. However we do want to demonstrate the benefits of engaging directly with developers.

SPEAKER: INGO KECK (35 Minutes)

Title: ""Find Out What Is Behind Your Data: Independent Component Analysis (ICA)""

Description:

Imagine you have a bunch of data and you want to find out what are the processes that created it. Then Independent Component Analysis (ICA) may be able to help you (if certain requirements are fulfilled, as usually). While the subject usually is hidden behind a layer of difficult to understand high order statistics and information theory, the basics are actually easy to explain and the applications numerous, from separating book page scans to high speed WIFI networks. In this talk I will give a short introduction on ICA (very low on maths) with a focus on applications and how to do it in Python.

Title: Text mining: Finding hidden information in CRM data

Description: A client in the energy sector wanted to create predictive behavioural models of business customers at the company level, but the CRM data was messy, often containing several sub-accounts for each business, without any grouping identifiers, and so aggregation was impossible. In this talk I describe a short project where we used text mining, a handful of unsupervised learning techniques, and pragmatic use of human skill under time & budgetary constraints, to identify the true company level structures in the CRM data.

Level: Intermediate

Description:

While developing games, one of the key things you really need to have is the ability to iterate often, and quickly, and when you're dealing with many different teams (devs, artists, designers), this can lead to an incredibly confusing and difficult environment to manage, so having a strong, efficient support system for managing, and manipulating resources is pivotal. When you then mix in releases, and abilities to rollback, and manage versioning, this becomes even more important.

Talk 1: Brian Carter on Text mining project based on Pillreports.net - 45 mins
=============================================

Pillreports.net is an on-line database of reviews of Ecstasy pills. In consumer theory illicit drugs are experience goods, in that the contents are not known until the time of consumption. Websites like Pillreports.net, may be viewed as an attempt to bridge that gap, as well as highlighting instances, where a particular pill is producing undesirable effects.

This talk will present the experiences and insights from a text mining project using data scraped from the Pillreports.net site. The setting up and the benefits, ease of using BeautifulSoup package and pymnogo to store the data in MongoDB will be outlined.A brief overview of some interesting parts of data cleansing will be detailed.
Insights and understanding of the data gained from applying classification and clustering techniques will be outlined. In particular visualizations of decision boundaries in classification using """"most important variables"""". Similarly visualizations of PCA projections for understanding cluster separation will be detailed to illustrate cluster separation.

The talk will be presented in the iPython notebook and all relevant datasets and code will be supplied. Python Packages Used: (bs4, matplotlib, nltk, numpy, pandas, re, seaborn, sklearn, scipy, urllib2)""

Talk 2: Using PyKE Rule Engine in a Django system for making decisions - 15 mins
=============================================

Brief overview of rule engines / expert systems; Practical use of rule engines; Existing options for rule engines in Python; Pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs of PyKE; practical tips of using PyKE; considerations when incorporating a rules engine into an existing system, overview/architecture of an existing Django based system that uses PyKE.

About Shane Devane:
Shane is a developer of 17+ years mostly from a web systems and currently working on a social project involving real time photo validation using a Python/Django stack. He works as a .NET developer.

Talk 3: ""Mixing multiprocessing and threads in the UNIX environment: DOs and DONTs (mostly DONTs) - 45 mins
=============================================

The subject of the presentation are the problems which arise when mixing threading and multiprocessing in Unix from the point of view of the Python developer. Some general concepts about the Unix APIs are refreshed, then we move and see how these are used inside Python and what problems result when deciding to use threads.""

About Enrico Franchi:
I am a Software Development Engineer at Amazon and a founding member of Python Italia A.p.S., I have been involved in organizing Pycon Italia and EuroPython, where I delivered multiple talks. My main interests are related to distributed systems, functional programming and software engineering. I love coding, Unix, maths, essential designs and Python.

Talk: Python Development Using Nix By Michael Twomey
-------------------------------------------

""Virtualenv for all your non-python stuff""

NixOS and the Nix package manager bill themselves as having a ""purely functional"" approach to managing your OS and packages. While this sounds fancy what this boils down to is the ability to create environments for your projects which have everything they need, with exact versions in that single environment (even down to your libc).

This talk will describe Nix (and a little about its bigger sibling, NixOS), and then go on to show you how to use Nix to make your development life a little easier.

Want to experiment with a new version of a major dependency but you don't want to break your system version? Easy, create a Nix environment with just that version updated.

Want to fix an issue on that old project which depended on an older version of a library? No problem, its Nix environment will have exactly what it needs, independent of everything else on your system.

Bonus: it works the same on Mac and Linux, so don't need to faff around with VMs and Docker to hack on stuff.

Talk 2: A Matplotlib User Guide, Part I by Anthony Munnelly
--------------------------------------------
The sheer size of the Matplotlib documentation can make it very tricky to navigate. I've had to navigate it, and now I'd like to come back and show the path to others. I hope to look at line, scatter, bar and boxplots, as well as figure and axes objects. I'm saving histograms and dates for later, I think.

------------------------------------------------------------------
This main objective of this talk is about applying the principles defined by Robert Martin as regards 'Clean Architecture' ( http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html ) and ported to the python ecosystem by Brandon Routh. I had a 'breakthrough' moment while carrying out some refactoring work recently by applying the principles outlined in the link above. This allowed me to refactor and write unit-tests 'easily' with the added benefit of making future refactoring efforts easier and safer in the future. It will consist of a few examples of how & why I refactored some existing python code to make it more testable by extracting the core business rules and placing them in 'pure' functions i.e. no side effects. Any IO i.e. DB or API calls are placed at the top of the call stack so that they can be easily replaced.

Talk 2: Ladyball: The Story of a Hashtag by Anthony Munnelly (https://ie.linkedin.com/in/anthonymunnelly) (30 Mins)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lidl Ireland and the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association decided to do some guerrilla marketing to announce Lidl's sponsorship of the sport. It got people talking, but a lot of people just didn't think it was funny. So what I hope to do is to mine Twitter data that featured the #ladyball hashtag and see what we can conclude from it. Tweepy is the module I'll use to do this.

So the presentation will be
1. Intro to Tweepy
2. Using Tweepy to mine tweet data
3. Cleaning up that data for analysis
4. Searching for patterns in the data

All with a view to answering the question: is there really no such thing as bad publicity?

About Anthony Munnelly

Talk 2: Building data pipelines with Luigi by Nicolas Laurance (40mins)

""The purpose of Luigi is to address all the plumbing typically associated with long-running batch processes. You want to chain many tasks, automate them, and failures will happen. These tasks can be anything, but are typically long running things like Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org/) jobs, dumping data to/from databases, running machine learning algorithms, or anything else.""

I will show the principle of building a data pipeline with luigi, and share my recent experience with this tool. Hopefully attendance will have an overview to decide whether this tool can be helpful for their day to day batch treatments.

By: Eric Holscher

Description: This talk will have four parts:

* Why Write Documentation

* Semantic Markup

* Sphinx

* Read the Docs

The beginning of this talk will cover why you should write documentation. Every talk to developers about documentation I feel needs this part, because when you talk about docs people are inherently skeptical. Once people get on board that docs are important, you can cover more interesting concepts.

Then we will walk through the concepts around semantic documentation writing. Similar to Semantic HTML, this allows you to mark up your documentation with metadata that gives you a lot more power and flexibility around the display and authoring of documentation.

Then we‚Äôll have a basic introduction to Sphinx. This will talk about the power that Sphinx gives you to write documentation, and examples of how to use it. We will also cover the semantic power of Sphinx, playing on the previous section to understand it in practice.

Then at last we‚Äôll cover how to host your documentation on Read the Docs. This will make your documentation beautiful with a custom theme, and allow you to host multiple versions and formats of your docs.

Talk 1 - The Missing Manual for GP-GPU Computation with Python Numba

Python Numba is an excellent module to obtain LLVM optimization without delving into Cython. It also promises similar level of abstraction for GP-GPU optimization with CUDA. However, as always, things don't go swimmingly with few simple modifications; add poor documentation and minimal concern for backwards-compatibility, you find yourself bewildering through CUDA tutorials and C++ codes, which you wanted to avoid in the first place. In this talk I'll try to produce the missing manual for GP-GPU Computation using Python Numba so that next generations won't suffer; until they change the code again, of course.

- Ertuƒürul Karademir

Lightening Talk - Python in Space Science - Daniel Vagg

Talk 2 - Design a word clock facade using a genetic algorithm

Word clocks are a family of mural or table clocks that
display time in plain text, like ""it's ten past two"".

How to fit all possible ways to spell the time in a grid ?
For the fun of it, the approach here is to use a genetic algorithm.

Randomly evolving a population of possible solutions, generation
after generation until eventually a solution is reached.

In this 30-35 minutes talk I'll present the detailed code in
a Jupyter notebook, and an quick overview of the results obtained.

Introduction to Django by Diarmuid Bourke

Abstract:

This will be a high level talk about a beginners introduction to Django. I'll go through how to get Django installed in a development environment and a production (Heroku) environment. How to read and understand the documentation for Django. I'll lightly cover how to manage a database with Django (so broad, this could be a talk on it's own). By the end of the talk, we'll hopefully have a basic blog which can be administered through the Django admin tool.

TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research.

This talk will discuss what TensorFlow is and what it can be used for using examples such as neural networks, transfer learning along with the toolkit for visualization using word2vec and Mandelbrot as examples. Finally a basic depoyment example will be shown using Flask and Heroku.

We have two talks for today:

Talk 1: Elias Kelly - An introduction to spacy.io for NLP in Python

Natural language processing is a major area in machine learning currently used for deriving meaning from language using statistical model to intemperate meaning from text data. Spacy.io is a python library which is written from the ground up in carefully memory-managed Cython. Independent research has confirmed that spaCy is the fastest in the world. If your application needs to process entire web dumps, spaCy is the library you want to be using. In this talk I will be going over some of the basics of spacy and what it can do and what meanings we can find from text.

Talk 2: Antonio Bevilacqua - Learn to curse with Python

Every programming language has its caveats, traps, tricks and nonsenses - its wats. While simple and consistent, Python is not out of the game, albeit most of its edge behaviors are not apparent, as they are caused by underlying code optimization. In this talk, I'm going to show some of the most common Python gotchas, referring to the CPython implementation version 3.5, showing how they can lead unaware or inexperienced programmers to catastrophic and unexpected results. There will be space, of course, for simple Easter eggs left around by humorous contributors!

This month we have a talk from Ben Watt:
An IoT solution built by novices. A father and son's Raspberry Pi Facial Recognition Project in detail.

After attending a Raspberry Pi hands-on makers session, Ben & his 13 year old son Callum wanted to take on their own project. The goal was to incorporate the Raspberry Pi, Python scripting, Camera & Sensor and Facial recognition APIs. You will see how they started from no knowledge to getting an application up and running, with Python at the heart. The process takes a photo based on either motion or button pressing, passes the photo for verification & outputs who it recognises and even if they look happy, sad or angry! The data is also loaded to cloud services for permanent storage and even mobile phone notifications and viewing. Both Ben and Callum will present and walk through a working application and dive into the code.

Description:
PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for Deep Learning, and is a recent newcomer to the growing list of GPU programming frameworks available in Python. Like other frameworks it offers efficient tensor representations and is agnostic to the underlying hardware. However, unlike other frameworks it allows you to create ‚Äúdefine-by-run‚Äù neural networks resulting in dynamic computation graphs, where every single iteration can be different‚Äîopening up a whole new world of possibilities. Central to all neural networks in PyTorch is the Autograd package, which performs Algorithmic Differentiation on the defined model and generates the required gradients at each iteration. In this talk I will present a gentle introduction to the PyTorch library and overview its main features using some simple examples, paying particular attention to the mechanics of the Autograd package.

This month we'll have David Gibbons talking about The Role of Python in SPAs (Single-Page Applications).

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates that page as the user interacts with the application. It has become a popular choice for certain applications built with client-side JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS and React. However Python has a role to play as a server-side language in creating APIs and other functionality.

In this talk I will give an introduction to SPAs, and the role that Python plays. I will also show an example application using Python as the server-side language. The target audience is software engineers with some knowledge of web applications or some basic Django knowledge.

About David:
I am software developer working with OpenApp in Dublin city center. I have used Python Web frameworks, in particular Django, to help create web applications including single-page applications.

Summary:
Most online multiplayer games do not allow scripted (AI) players. Arenarium is built specifically for AI players.
The first game on the platform is a simple Arena-style game. The rules are simple: fight the other players until only one remains.
We built Arenarium to be fun for both beginners and machine learning experts. With both a set of building blocks that can be used for beginners and full access to the game state for those who want to build complex strategies. Agents have persistent memory between games, which enables them to learn.

The core of Arenarium is built with Python, and the code players upload is Python. Arenarium is free and completely open-source.
We will give a brief overview of the architecture of the platform and a tutorial in how to build your first agent.

*Anton Masalovich*:
People usually tends to think only in terms of their native language when develop text processing functions. And then if they get input in other language a lot of interesting things can happen. It is worth to think about international support on early stages when you wrote any long living code, to save yourself some nasty surprises later. Purpose of this talk is to show several common pitfalls in text processing that needs to be taken care from international point of view and how someone can work around them.

Thinking about maintainability, *David McIllwee*

Running in Production and changing over time, some of the most important (and often forgotten) factors that impact what we do.
Minor decisions early on can have major impact when time is tight.
Designing for Production, learning the hard-won lessons of others and building a solid foundation can help you save time and concentrate on the fun/challenging parts.

Well, Machine Learning can look like magic, but you don't need to be a data scientist or an ML researcher to develop with ML.
So, what about making your solution smarter without any knowledge in AI? With pre-trained models and just a few lines of Python code, Machine Learning APIs can analyze your data. Moreover, AutoML techniques can now help in getting even more specific insights tailored to your needs.
In this session, you‚Äôll see how to transform or extract information from text, image, audio & video with the latest ML APIs, how to train an AutoML custom model, and you‚Äôll be an active player of a live demo. Don't put your smartphone in airplane mode!

Presentation and demonstration of a small Python programme to display and record data from a (Measurement Computing USB-2404-UI) DAQ strain digitizer.

Mike Solomon : Testing code with third-party API integrations

In this talk we will examine strategies and best practices to develop and test code that makes use of third-party API integrations. As reliance on third-party services becomes more and more prevalent in the python ecosystem, developers need cost-effective, secure, reliable and fast ways to mock these services for both dev/staging environments and testing.

Oxidizing MyPy: Typed Python, Rust and Rust-in-Python.
Python is a very readable, dynamically typed, interpreted, object oriented general purpose programming language that‚Äôs easy to learn, but offers almost unlimited power and flexibility to build almost whatever you want. However, as you go deeper into Python, some of the very features that made you fall in love with the language may start to limit what you can do: dynamic typing can make bugs hard to spot, large codebases can create a sea of objects, and the global interpreter lock (GIL) starts to impose a hard limit on performance.

The gentle touch of APM - how code tracing works in Python

It has been a busy several years in monitoring and observability. As we‚Äôve hit limits on the visibility and detail that logging and metrics provide, we‚Äôve turned to tracing and APM (App Performance Monitoring) systems. We can now understand performance bottlenecks and see errors in our apps down to the line of code. But how do they really work under the hood? Come and find out! We'll walk through how a free APM system works - Elastic APM.

- an overview of typical Python web framework structure
- Elastic APM's tech architecture
- how its Python agent hooks deep into web apps and Celery back-ends
- how Python trace data is processed and visualised
- how it avoids hitting production web app performance while tracing

This talk is friendly to a variety of backgrounds and levels of experience.

- Dr Hayley Evers-King is a marine applications expert at EUMETSAT in the User support and Climate Services division. She provides user support and training on ocean applications of satellite data and manages feedback between the user(s) and operational satellite agencies, mostly in support of the European Commission Copernicus Programme. Her research background covers the use of optics to derive information about the oceans. She has worked throughout the satellite data value chain from the validation of satellite sensor measurements, to algorithm development and data use for various applications including harmful algal blooms, ocean heat flux, carbon pools, climate model validation and marine spatial planning. She is a keen programmer, focusing exclusively on open source tools, and a passionate science communicator seeking novel ways to use new media to share science with new satellite data users and the public.

[Abstract]
The oceans are a vast and vital part of how our planet functions. Like many parts of the environment, they both support and are under threat from, human activities. This makes monitoring the oceans of fundamental importance. However, because of their size, comprehensive monitoring of the oceans is impossible to do in-person. Enter an array of incredible tools ‚Äì complex computer simulations, arrays of robots, and fleets of satellites. Big problems are being addressed with big data, but this can lead to big challenges for the average scientist, conservationist, fisherman, or policy maker who work in ocean-related sectors. Python, along with open data and open science principles, is a key tool for helping to address these challenges. In this talk, I‚Äôll share an overview of how satellites are helping us to see our seas, and how Python is being used across the satellite value chain ‚Äì from satellite operations, to global and regional policy decisions, all the way to supporting individual fishermen.

********
Speakers:

- Isaac Evans is the leader of r2c, a small startup working on giving security tools directly to developers. Previously, he conducted research into binary exploitation bypasses for techniques like control-flow integrity and novel hardware defences on new architectures like RISC-V as a researcher at the US Defense Department under an SFS program and at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Isaac received his BS/MS degrees in EECS from MIT. Other interests include next-generation programming languages, secure-by-design frameworks, software-defined radio, and the intersection of cryptography and public policy.
Find him on twitter as @0xine or at https://keybase.io/ine.

[Abstract - track I]
r2c is a startup working to profoundly improve software security and reliability to safeguard human progress. We are a team of AppSec engineers and program analysis experts. Having analyzed thousands of open source projects and spoken with hundreds of Python developers, we identified common security pitfalls that are specific to Python web apps. We partnered with authors of major web frameworks to identify common ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù and create a set of best practices for building robust Python web apps.
The tutorial will include:
- A brief overview of common security problems (OWASP Top 10);
- Common gotchas for Flask and Django;
- Tools for robust Python backend development;
- Q&A.

####

- Stephen is a senior software engineer at Red Hat. He's been heavily involved in the OpenStack community since 2015, including related projects across the Python ecosystem. He also maintains Patchwork, the patch tracking tool used by the kernel and many other FOSS communities. He holds a BEng in Computer Engineering from the University of Limerick and has a keen interest in virtualisation, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).

[Abstract - track II]
Django REST Framework (DRF) does for REST APIs what Django does for web applications more generally. That is, it provides a powerful, flexible framework to help quickly building applications. OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) provides a machine-readable schema for describing the REST APIs made possible by the likes of DRF. When combined, they allow you to do some pretty neat things, which we're going in this talk.
I will cover:
- Automatic generation of schemas from your API
- Validation of APIs using schemas
- Documentation!
- The competition

Let's see if OpenAPI really is the one API schema to rule them all... or something like that.

7 pm WORKSHOP: Chatbot from Command Line;
8:30 pm - Q & A;
9 pm - If no further, closing.

**********

THE WORKSHOP:
In this workshop, you will get to build your first chatbot from the command line using Rasa open source and Python.

You'll build an assistant that can:
- detect what the intent of the user is;
- parse the text to retrieve important references;
- use custom python code in the conversation;
- stick to predefined stories (we'll see a hugging face demo to demonstrate why this is a nice thing);
- actively learn from your conversations.

We'll also briefly discuss topics in NLP in general, like named entity recognition, but the main goal though is to get a working assistant running locally.

Rasa works on top of TensorFlow 2 but you won't need to be familiar with it to get it to run.

If you're new to python, or if you want to make a head start, then you may appreciate these two installation guides for Rasa:
- macOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqzsE70Rvr0
- windows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ewIABo0OkU
- ubuntu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXiYJM2vGJk

-----------

THE WORKSHOPPER

Vincent D. Warmerdam is a Research Advocate at Rasa where he helps the research team explain and explore modern NLP algorithms for digital assistants. You may have seen him before at PyData.
You can usually find him on stage defending common sense over hype, but you may also have seen some of his open source projects (scikit-lego, evol and whatlies) or some of his online videos (spaCy, algorithm whiteboard). He blogs over at koaning.io.

**********

THE TALK:
On the last Sunday of October you may get ‚Äúone more hour of sleep‚Äù but as well may spend much more time debugging code dealing with the time zones, daylight saving time shifts and datetime stuff in general.

We'll look at a few pitfalls you may encounter when working with datetimes in Python. We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it contains over 500 individual time zones while focusing on the Europe/Dublin entry. We'll find the reason why pytz is not part of the standard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't solve all your problems. Do you know what happens if the EU stops DST switching?

Two centuries of short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in thirty minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in your code altogether!

Talks:

1. Arjumand Younus - ""Needle in the Haystack Problem for Scientific Literature: How Python can Help?""

Over recent years there is explosive growth in the number of scientific publications that are being produced leading to an information overload for someone new to an area, or even for experts at top of their game. As in other areas where there's been a deluge of material like movies, songs, products the strategy of recommender systems works effectively at narrowing down what one is looking for. The question next is then can we use some of those strategies for navigating through the storm of scientific publications and the answer is yes; this talk will explore some ways in which Python can help us with that.

2. Mridu Bhatnagar - ""Get Word Of the Day SMS using Python and Twilio""
This talk will discuss how to build a mechanism to get a word and its definition as SMS. This is a good way to learn new words every day and improve your vocabulary.

Speaker's Bio:

Dr Brett Becker and Dr Keith Quille: Leaving Certificate Computer Science Python

In this presentation, Dr Brett Becker (UCD) and Dr Keith Quille (TU Dublin) will discuss the Leaving Certificate Computer Science course with respect to the Python content. We will walk through all of the aspects covered in that course which may allow many members of Python Ireland to get involved and help out this new initiative, or at the least know what is expected from second-level students. This overview will cover topics such as introductory Python programming, more advanced Python programming, algorithms, embedded systems, databases and testing (use case tests and unit testing) which all use Python. Following this overview, we will present our efforts to help students and teachers showcasing a recently published book for the subject. We will specifically walk through a sample chapter on introductory Python programming that may be of value to Python Ireland which members will have access to! Keith also teaches and coordinates the Applied Machine Learning and Applied AI and Deep Learning courses for final year undergraduates in TU Dublin (Tallaght campus), and would be happy to discuss questions in this area also.

‚ÄúTextual Learning in Python ‚Äì Topic modeling and related techniques for reading text‚Äù

Summary:
---------------
The talk will start with a brief overview of Python‚Äôs main Natural Language Processing (NLP) packages. The focus of the talk will start with a raw dataset of news articles, then going through the pre-processing stages required when working with text, and finally showing how topic modeling can be used to understand the topics of these documents. Topic modeling is a probabilistic inference technique that clusters groups of words and phrases used to identify common topics across
documents. The focus in the talk will be on core Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, but some of the newer topic model and related techniques will also be explored.

This month we are proud to host two speakers:

- Talk I: Deploy JupyterHub with Dask Gateway on Kubernetes in 15 minutes
Deploying and maintaining a Dask+JupyterHub cluster on the Cloud is a very difficult task. Throw Kubernetes in there and it can all get overwhelming quite fast. With that challenge in mind, we decided to build a platform that uses Infrastructure-as-Code to handle and simplify such deployments. We call it: QHub. In this talk, I will show how QHub allows teams and individuals to build scalable data science environments under 15 minutes, deploying them to multiple Cloud providers. Kubernetes for those who don't know Kubernetes.Check out the projects at github.com/quansight/qhub-cloud and github.com/quansight/qhub-onprem.

-Talk II: Adding structure to a sea of chaos: a principled approach to authorization using Python + SQLAlchemy

Authorization is an unstructured problem. Writing code to decide who can do what in your app can cover a broad set of cases. The most structure that typically gets applied to this problem area is a set of if statements and roles, but in reality, there are a lot more patterns and structure that we can apply. oso is an open source system for building authorization into applications. It's a bit like SQLAlchemy in that it provides a structured approach to authorization, much like SQLAlchemy does for data modeling and access. In this talk, we'll provide a mental model for authorization and show how to apply it using oso, Python and SQLAlchemy.

Speaker: Sam Scott
Cofounder and CTO of oso. He's received a PhD in Cryptography, is an engineer by training, and can discuss anything from authorization and security patterns in SQLAlchemy, to how oso works under the hood and interfaces with Python via FFI, to trends in security policy-as-code and his contributions to TLS 1.3.

A Review of Hyperparameter Optimization Frameworks on Python

Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the optimum values that control the learning process for a machine learning algorithm. This can span from a single regularization value for logistic regression to searching for optimal architectures in a Neural Network. It is also arguably one of the most time-consuming operations that can easily take days or weeks. In this talk, we'll take a look at the common ways and recent developments to perform this crucial step and compare some of the open-source options that exist in the Python ecosystem. This is a beginner to intermediate level talk that will cover some basics.

Packaging: improve your Python supply-chain
---------------------------------------------------------------

Packaging is an important step in getting Python software from developers to users. It's a big topic. The ecosystem is changing with new tools and grant funding. This talk will introduce the topic, highlight some of the choices and illustrate a few options for creating Python software packages. It will focus on open source tools. It won't assume any prior packaging experience and should include new ideas for experienced Python developers.

Keith is passionate about Python and open source software. He has used Python in organisations large and small and briefly worked for a packaging startup. He's seen a range of approaches to Python packaging and hopes to share some of that experience.

Optimization (Linear & Mixed Integer Programming) for Pythonistas
=================================================================

Most Pythonistas these days are fairly aware of what Machine Learning can do for them. Even if you don‚Äôt use it in the day-job, you are likely to have at least read the blogs and maybe tried your hand at a Kaggle challenge or a CNN to recognize your cat. We frequently use ML in our AI practise at Last Mile, but we find that many business problems we encounter don‚Äôt fit that mould. A fair number of these are best represented as combinatorial optimizations. In the last few years, the Python community has developed software like PYOMO and Google/OR that allow you to set up these problems and solve them in a really intuitive, Pythonic way. There‚Äôll be a bit of maths but not a lot. Mainly, the talk will be about how to model a problem as an optimization, design a Python program, develop it and get to an optimal solution.

Orbit Modelling Using Symplectic Integrators in Python.
======================================================

This short talk, based on my Final Year Project, discusses the differences between symplectic and nonsymplectic integration techniques and how symplectic integrators may be applied to spacecraft orbit modelling. The talk also describes how symplectic propagator functions modelled using Python may be interfaced with NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) in order to augment its in-built selection of propagation functions.

I'm Ben McKeon, I'm 22 years-old and a freshly-minted graduate of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Limerick. I'm a self-confessed space geek and will begin a Master's degree in Space Science and Technology at UCD this coming September. I hope to carry forward the work I've done as part of my Final Year Project and conduct research into Spacecraft Flight Dynamics.

Quantum Computation with Python
===============================

Quantum Computation is all the hype right now in the research world, with its applications in various fields like data science, machine learning, finance, chemistry, optimization and many more.
But before we can dive into the advanced and complex topics in quantum computation, we need to understand the basics.
In this talk, Harshdeep will present the basics of quantum computation, starting from the description of qubits, and how quantum computation differs from the classical computation by considering the example of a coin toss and how that will differ in classical and quantum worlds.
Harshdeep will then discuss some other concepts from quantum mechanics that form the basis of the quantum computation in general, while using the Qiskit package in Python side by side to give this tutorial a more hands-on outlook.

Mini Bio
========

Harshdeep is a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, where his area of research is quantum computation, primarily working in applications of variational quantum algorithms in various fields like chemistry, optimization and ML.
Harshdeep has a background in physics with a BSc (honors) and MSc in Physics from Jadavpur University.
He writes about different topics and new breakthroughs in quantum computing on his blog https://theharshjourney.wordpress.com/

***Optimise like a scientist***

Poorly performing Numpy and Pandas code costs time and money. Try to solve this by just throwing the latest hot new library at it will probably cost you more time and money. In this talk I'll show you instead how to optimise your code like a scientist - that is by building little control experiments, measuring the results and testing, testing, testing to make sure your results remain correct. With this process I will then show you how to throw the hottest new libraries at your problem to make code that runs so fast your computer may just melt.

**Target audience**: data scientists in particular, but the process & tools for optimising is general to all python users

**""Surf height predictions at Lahinch with a Serverless ML System in 100% Python""**

Many machine learning models never make it to production. Apart from your model, you need at least three programs to build a production ML system:
\* a feature pipeline to transform (new) input data into features;
\* an inference pipeline turns features into predictions;
\* a service/product/application/UI that is enhanced with add ""intelligence"" using the model and input data.
In this talk, we show you how to take the next step after training models. We show you how to build a serverless ML system. We will work with the important problem of predicting wave heights at Lahinch beach in County Clare. The system is written in only Python. It is hosted on free serverless services - Github (compute, UI) and Hopsworks (features, models).

Mini Bio : Jim Dowling is CEO of Logical Clocks and an Associate Professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. He is lead architect of the open-source Hopsworks platform, a horizontally scalable data platform for machine learning that includes the industry‚Äôs first Feature Store.

A talk by **Peter Vidos**, CEO & Co-Founder of Vizzu ([https://vizzuhq.com](https://vizzuhq.com/))
[https://www.linkedin.com/in/petervidos/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petervidos/)

**Description:**
Sharing and explaining the results of your analysis can be a lot easier and more fun when you can create an animated story of the charts containing your insights. ipyvizzu-story ([https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu-story](https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu-story)) - a new open-source tool - enables just that with a simple Python interface within Jupyter & other computational notebooks and similar platforms.

In this talk, one of the creators of ipyvizzu-story shows how their technology works and provides examples of the advantages of using animation for storytelling with data.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

During this talk, Ben will give a brief description of the Python tools used as part of the Breakthrough Listen project in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). In particular, I look at turboSETI, an algorithm used to find anomalous signals in telescope data and Blimpy, (Breakthrough Listen I\O Methods for Python) a framework for handling the large files generated by this search. He will also discuss briefly his work with the Parkes telescope in Australia before examining how these libraries can be adapted for use on LOFAR telescopes, such as the one stationed at Birr Castle here in Ireland.
**Target audience**: Python enthusiasts with an interest in astrophysics and space more generally. This talk contains no advanced mathematics, so beginners are more than welcome!

We have two interesting talks this time. Look forward to meeting you.

***Talk 1:***

* **Topic:** Python education for adults
* **Description:** We will be discussing the state of python education for adult career switchers. This talk considers a survey of adult career switchers to see what methods were most successful, what educational background was associated with the best outcome, and what we can do as a community to support people wanting to pursue a career in programming.
* **Speaker:** [Mykalin Jones](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/mykalin-jones-584047123)
* **Speaker Bio:** Mykalin is a data scientist and founder of Astrotutors. She writes curricula for teaching children and adults python, provides individual and group lessons, and leads corporate training sessions in Python.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

***Talk 2:***

* **Topic:** Constraint Programming with Google OR-Tools in Python
* **Description:** You might have heard of Mathematical Programming for Optimization, using techniques like Linear Programming and Mixed Integer Programming for resource allocation, e.g., deciding how many scooters a factory should make. However, these methods falter with scheduling problems like Vehicle Routing. Enter Constraint Programming, leveraging search algorithms to handle multi-dimensional constraints, like vehicle allocation plus weather. Google's OR team used it to revolutionize global shipping. Use OR-Tools in Python to tackle your own complex problems and become a shipping magnate or similar!
* **Speaker:** [John Curry](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/john-curry-b4750015)
* **Speaker Bio:** John is CEO of [www.lastmile-ai.com](http://www.lastmile-ai.com/) , a consultancy that does mathematical optimisation, full-stack data-intensive applications and a bunch of other stuff, mostly with Python."

Deoir; tear
-oir; suffix, ‚Äò-er‚Äô
Taighdeoir; researcher

The Irish language has a number of comprehensive and up-to-date online learning tools, databases, and dictionaries. However, there was no way for Irish learners or users to search for specific substrings, despite their importance in Irish to denote number (singular or plural), gender, case, and noun declension (how a noun is conjugated or pluralised).

This talk will discuss the process of creating an application in Python to remedy this problem, and will present our solution, **M√≠read√≥ir**, a search tool for Irish-language substrings. It is hoped that this tool will benefit language teachers and learners, and every-day Irish users. With substrings also encompassing suffixes, it is also possible that this tool could act as a rhyming dictionary or support in creative writing.

The talk will consider the collaboration between an Irish-language translator and scholar, and a data scientist and Irish-language learner; the implications of machine learning on language learning and translation; and offer a beginner-friendly discussion on web scraping, string processing, and creating a bilingual front-end for a data science project.

**Mykalin Jones** is a data scientist, curriculum writer, instructor, and passionate learner of the Irish language.

**A detailed look at a niche library/technology for calculations, calculang**: calculang is a language for calculations.
