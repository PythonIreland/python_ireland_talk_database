"""
Application Use Cases Layer (Ring 2) - Application Business Rules

This module contains the application-specific business rules. These use cases orchestrate
the flow of data to and from the entities and direct those entities to use their
Critical Business Rules to achieve the goals of the use case.

Use cases should not know anything about how the data is presented to the user or how
the data is stored. They should only know about the entities and their business rules.
