Its style is opinionated and strict, and it brings a consistent style and today's best practices. How do I bring my legacy codebase up to this standard?A Consistent style and standard and the consistent use of the same tools in all your code, makes it easier to reason about, reduces context switching, thus reducing waste (in the LEAN sense). A clean environment is good for your health and safety, enabling you to deliver quality faster.This talk goes deeper into how to modernize your legacy codebase to reduce your technical debt, to make it easier for you to tackle the real challenges without ever having to discuss a style guide again. It will provide tips, tricks and tools to make your “hypermodernization” effort as smooth and easy as possible."

At the outset of each project, every effort is made to ensure that each stage in the lifecycle of the project will run as smoothly as possible to meet key milestones.This means that the processes and methods applied by each discipline in turn, from Design through to Test and Evaluation, must be robust and proven to meet the demands of the work performed by each of the groups involved.Python provides our Design Evaluation group with those robust and proven processes and tools to get the job done.AbstractThe main goal of IC Evaluation is to determine whether or not the device meets a range of important performance specifications. In order to achieve this goal, many IC's are tested extensively across a range of conditions (ambient temperature, supply voltage, etc.) on custom designed printed circuit boards, resulting in varying amounts of data being gathered, processed and ultimately analyzed to extract actionable information. Within our Design Evaluation group, this testing is accomplished by leveraging the tools and methods that make up our Evaluation Python framework.This talk will offer a high level overview of the suite of Python tools developed by our group over time with an emphasis on two libraries in particular: - Test & Measurement Instrument Drivers ○ The control of a wide range of laboratory instruments is key to efficient measurement execution and our suite of Instrument Drivers written in Python play a key role here. By using a simple and easily customizable JSON template technique, the generation of the Python code for the lowest level instrument commands ensures consistent base code with minimized chances of human error and ultimately reliable evaluation measurements. - Integrated Circuit Register Map Parsing Tool ○ Most Integrated Circuits will have thousands of internal registers that provide the means by which the part can be configured. A suitable interface must be provided to our Python Environment in order to program the part correctly as part of the Evaluation process. The parsing tool automatically generates this Python based interface from an XML file in a convenient hierarchical structure."

They work with increased sophistication targeting the digital supply chain we build our products on, targeting not just us, but our providers, customers, users and employees. In this session, we get to understand these hacking groups from the inside as ethical hacker Mackenzie Jackson breaks down the facades used by these groups, from their structure to the economic principles they rely on. We use this understanding to answer the question, “How do we design, build and ship digital products that are secure?”. By examining the anatomy of recent high-profile security attacks, we will explore exactly how these attackers were able to target organizations through weaknesses, not just in applications, but in the dependencies and tools they rely on. These dependencies, like cloud infrastructure, third-party services and open-source packages make 90% of our applications today and can leave us vulnerable through no fault of our own, like being a passenger in a car crash. Using this knowledge we explore how we can take back control of security in our products by reviewing:- How we can incorporate security into how we design, build and ship our python applications from day zero. - The key steps you can take when building products are to enforce and maintain security. - Ensuring the products we ship are secure and maintaining security throughout their entire life. Most importantly we explore why security doesn’t need to be boring and how you can get your entire team excited about designing, building, and shipping secure products today. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The outline of this presentation will be:What are modern hackers - We explore Hackonomics 101, how hacking groups operate and how they target your products. Exploring modern attacks - We break apart recent high-profile security incidents and explore exactly how attackers were able to exploit vulnerabilities baked into our software supply chain. Understanding our own vulnerabilities - Your attack exposure is bigger than you think, 90% of the code that makes our applications run are from our dependencies. Attackers probably know your code better than you do. Designing for security - Security gets harder, more expensive and more painful the further we get. We look at how we can build a security plan when designing our products from day zero. Building for security - A plan is nothing without action. What can we do to build secure products, key steps to take and best practices to follow. Shipping securely - Vulnerabilities can be introduced at any moment, don't let final mistakes cost you. Best practices to ship secure productsMaintaining a secure product - Secure doesn’t end when you ship a product you need a plan and actionable steps to keep your product secure for its entire life. Making security fun - Security needs by in from the entire team to work, how can we make security fun and accessible to everyone."

Pytest provides lots of tools for you to write better tests, however, not all of them we are familiar with. Let's revisit them and see how they can be used to write better tests.In this talk, we will visit some valuable tools in Pytest, for example, parameterize, fixture and xfail. All of them provided what problem these tool is trying to solve, an example use case and an example code. The talk will be conducted in a storytelling kind of way, with an example project and writing a test suit to test different features in the project. The goal of this talk is to give beginner code a head start in improving their ability to write meaningful and complex tests.This talk is for beginner programmers and data scientists who can write Python code and know the basics of testing but have yet to get their hands dirty in writing complex tests that, for example, involve an external application, which will require extra tools from Pytest to achieve that.## Outline- Introduction and showing an example project (5 mins)- Using parameterize - what is the problem and how it solve it (5 mins)- Using fixture - what is a fixture and how can it be used - with example (10 mins)- Skipping and marking xfail for tests - why and how to do so (5 mins)- Conclusion (5 mins)"

Do you have friends trying to learn as an adult? Have you ever wondered if you would have been better off learning to code earlier in life? The push for more people to learn to code has caused an explosion in the educational industry. Boot camps and certification programs of dramatically varying quality have emerged in nearly every corner of the world. These programs are often accompanied by lofty claims and promises. Children have been no exception to this, as more and more companies attempt to capitalize on the claim that children should start learning early because it's ""like learning a language"". However, research suggests that this might not be the most solid argument. What benefits are there in teaching them early? How do children acquire programming knowledge? How does our language around the concepts affect their understanding? Can the answer to these questions inform how we teach adults coming in from non-STEM fields? This talk will focus on these questions by presenting the current data we have, in conjunction with anecdotal evidence from sessions with children who code in python."

To start with, let us view logs and traces as no different from any other data. The data an application indirectly generates when in use (the logs and traces) is no different from the data an application directly works with (input and output). So let’s keep them all together in a scalable cloud storage repository. Once it is there, it is just like any other big data. We need to analyze and apply intelligent monitoring to detect situations of interest. So we need to apply trained ML models to a stream of such data for immediate alerting when the traces indicate an unwanted behavior occurring or brewing. This talk will show how to harness existing technologies to do just that."
