Doing so correctly can feel as if we were detectives lining up the facts after all of the evidence has been thoroughly evaluated. This workshop aims to help programmers of various backgrounds and experience levels to effectively put on their detective hats and tell stories through data visualizations and dashboards using Python.This beginner-friendly workshop is split into three parts with exercises in each, and all three follow a top-down approach. This means that each time block starts with the punchline (i.e. the results) and we then we would work our way backward with clear explanations on how and why each question was asked, each function was created, and each choice was made. One of the added benefits of this approach is that participants will be able to take what they learn throughout the session and use it to analyze and reverse engineer datasets and results, respectively, that they might encounter in the wild.All you need to attend this workshop is your laptop, some knowledge of Python (1-year preferred), and a GitHub account.Here's a detailed outline of the session.Total time budgeted including breaks - 3 hours.1. **Introduction and Setup (~20 minutes)** - Environment set up. The workshop can be run locally in any IDE, and links to instances in GitHub Codespaces and Google Collab will also be provided. - Breakdown of the session. - Instructor intro.2. **Static Dashboards (~40 minutes)** - Intro to the problem, the dashboard, and the Python tools we'll use. - Static dashboard creation and customization. - Exercise (7 min). Participants will be given a dashboard with 3-5 visualizations and their task is to reverse engineer any of the visualizations in it.3. **15-minute break**4. **Interactive Dashboards (~40 minutes)** - Intro to the problem, the dashboard, and the Python tools we'll use. - Interactive dashboard creation and customization. - Dashboard and main functions breakdown - Exercise (7 min). Following the example of exercise 1, participants will take one of the static visualizations and make it into an interactive one. 5. **15-minute break**6. **Dashboard Deploying (~40 minutes)** - Overview of different deployment strategies and tools for both static and interactive dashboards. - Deploying a static dashboard via GitHub Pages. - Walk-through on how to deploy a dashboard app. - Exercise (7 min).

FHE has recently seen a lot of progress, and commercial applications of FHE are now available. One of the main application domains for FHE is privacy-preserving machine learning.In this one-hour tutorial, we aim to introduce the attendee to OpenFHE‚Äôs python wrapper, a powerful tool that democratizes FHE integration for non-cryptographers. The python wrapper provides an interface to the underlying SIMD computations, facilitating numpy-like vector operations allowing practitioners to incorporate FHE into their workflow in a familiar way.**Content of the Tutorial:**An introduction to OpenFHE‚Äôs Python Wrapper: We begin by introducing OpenFHE‚Äôs python wrapper; the wrapper enables python users to leverage OpenFHE without needing a background in C++. Demystified the Cryptography Parameters: The cryptography parameters can be daunting for the newcomer, so we break down these parameters, explaining their significance for a given machine learning problem. This knowledge will help attendees make informed decisions while working with FHE for their applications. we also provide attendees with heuristics to select the parameters. The goal is to need to learn how to select the right parameters for your specific use case. We‚Äôll guide you through this process, ensuring that you can confidently tailor OpenFHE to your requirements.Model Training: To reinforce the concepts covered earlier, we walk attendees through two example model trainings using OpenFHE: a linear regression model and a logistic regression model. Throughout the process, we compare and contrast various components with their Numpy counterparts, highlighting how similar an OpenFHE implementation looks and feels to a Numpy implementation. This hands-on approach will solidify the attendees understanding and equip them with best practices for integrating FHE into their machine learning projects.**Conclusion:**By the end of this tutorial, our users will have a firm grasp of Fully Homomorphic Encryption, its relevance in privacy-preserving machine learning, and the practical implementation of OpenFHE‚Äôs python wrapper. Attendees will gain the confidence to utilize this powerful tool in your workflow, knowing how to select the appropriate cryptography parameters and build models securely.

Do you have friends trying to learn as an adult? Are you an adult career-switcher?With so many resources for people getting started in programming, the options can be overwhelming. People often are left to wonder how and when to get started or what they can do to yield better outcomes. This talk will be a two-part discussion: first, on teaching children and second, on supporting adult career-switchers. For children, we will focus on fun and engaging ways to help them get started with coding in Python, how to decide if they are ready, and what can be helpful to do before that time comes. For Adults, we will discuss available resources, ideal learning plans, and realistic goals/outcomes. Emphasis will be placed on getting started, getting out of ""tutorial purgatory"" and getting into real, portfolio building, projects. For members of the Python community, we will be talking about getting involved through impactful mentorship."

This paper introduces Dbias, which is a Python package to ensure fairness in news articles. Dbias is a trained Machine Learning (ML) pipeline that can take a text (e.g., a paragraph or news story) and detects if the text is biased or not. It detects the biased words in the text, masks them, and recommends a set of sentences with new words that are bias-free or at least less biased. We incorporate the elements of data science best practices to ensure that this pipeline is reproducible and usable. We show in experiments that this pipeline can be effective for mitigating biases and outperforms the common neural network architectures in ensuring fairness in news articles."

While Static Analysis tools have existed for some time, modern tools have adapted to better integrate with developers‚Äô workflows. The goal is to help developers write higher quality, more secure code without disrupting their day-to-day workflows.Since the advent of agile software development, a heavy emphasis has always been placed on delivery speed and quick iteration in order to maximize the new value being provided to end users through new features. However, going too fast can mean taking shortcuts that, in the best case, makes your code messy and difficult to understand, or in the worst case can open your organization to security risks. Thus, Static Analysis is a critical tool to add to your organization‚Äôs workflow to minimize these issues without taking a major hit to developer productivity.In this talk, we‚Äôll cover: - The importance of shifting left and catching issues earlier to save developers time later in the software development life cycle- Overview of common issues and security vulnerabilities that can easily go missed in Python code (with examples)- What Static Analysis and Software Composition Analysis are, and how they help you shift left when looking for issues- How modern Static Analysis tools integrate with common developer tools (IDEs, Git Repos, CI) to be less disruptive while maintaining their impact"

Not only is this a cheap and flexible method for understanding the impact of changes to our ranking system, but it also opens the door for development of reinforcement learning systems (see https://www.gymlibrary.ml/ for examples of reinforcement learning in gaming environments)We will discuss the challenges to implementing a simulation engine, results from running simulations in the ranking team, and future directions for this approach."
